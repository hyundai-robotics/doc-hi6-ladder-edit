# 4.2 Checksum Compare
When the built-in PLC is in RUN or Remote Run mode, a checksum comparison function is provided to compare the currently viewed ladder diagram with the file downloaded to the built-in PLC. <br>

1. If the currently viewed ladder diagram is different from the file downloaded to the built-in PLC, a "difference" indicator (<>) will appear next to the title at the top of the monitoring window.<br>

2. If the ladder diagram is the same as the file downloaded to the built-in PLC, a "same" indicator (=) will appear next to the title at the top of the monitoring window.<br>
