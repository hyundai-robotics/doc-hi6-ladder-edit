# 1.1 Ladder Edit

The Ladder Edit function of the Hi6 controller is an embedded feature that allows users to directly create and edit ladder programs for the Hi6's built-in PLC.

The editing method is similar to HRLadder, a dedicated ladder editing PC software for Hyundai Robotics. Therefore, users who have experience editing ladder programs using HRLadder will be able to quickly familiarize themselves with the function through this manual.

HRLadder can be downloaded by searching for it on the Hyundai Robotics website (https://www.hd-hyundairobotics.com/main) - Customer Support - Download Center.
For instructions on how to use HRLadder, please refer to the user manual linked in the help menu of HRLadder.
